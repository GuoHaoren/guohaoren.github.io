# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
Hi! I am Haoren, a final year Ph.D candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore advised by [Professor Vadakkepat Prahlad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mq5ihGYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Professor Ho Weng Khuen. I am very fortunate to work closely with Prof. Lee Tong Heng and Prof. Abdullah Al Mamun in NUS, and Dr. Haiyue Zhu from SIMTech, A*Star.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National University of Singapore, with a distinction in May 2021. I have joined Huawei Singapore Research Center as Architectural Computing Algorithm Engineer from May, 2025.
